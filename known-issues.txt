Known Issues with SmartGit
==========================
Linux
-----
* SmartGit must be started using bin/smartgit.sh.

* tar.gz-bundle: To install a menu item or a launcher link use
  bin/add-menuitem.sh. Don't just try to pin the launched SmartGit instance to
  the Unity launcher, because clicking this will not launch the script and
  might cause hard crashes, e.g. because of
  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=419729
  where the work-around requires certain environment variables be set.

* KDE desktop with oxygen-gtk theme crashes when a combobox needs to be shown:

  ~/.smartgit/smartgit.vmoptions:
  
  -DSWT_GTK3=1
